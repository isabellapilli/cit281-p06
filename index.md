## PROJECT 6

```markdown
Learning Objectives:

1. Gain experience creating and working 
   classes with inheritance
2. Gain more experience creating and 
   working with classes
3. Gain more experience debugging code
4. Gain more experience using a generic
   block of code to process data
5. Gain more experience interpreting functional 
   descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment
6. Gain more experience writing and executing 
   non-web server Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode
7. Practice using modern JavaScript syntax
8. Gain more experience working with static dat

Overview: 

You will be creating three classes. The first class
is the Shape class that will serve as a base class 
for the other two classes. The second class is the 
Rectangle class that will inherit from Shape class. 
A class that inherits from another class can be called 
the child class of the base, or parent, class. The third 
class is the Triangle class that also will inherit from 
the Shape class.

```

### Technologies Used:
- VS Code
- Terminal


### What I Learned:
In this project, I experimented with class constructors again and created three classes: Shape, Rectange, and Triangle. The Rectangle and Triangle class both inherited from the Shape class using extends operator. Each class would expect a certain amount of parameters that would return the area and/or the perimeter. Lastly, I created a generic block of code that processed and tested the array of side arrays.
